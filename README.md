Todays code is about how to make a handwritten digits reader and how to upload images to computer with open cv (make sure if you run the code you need have 28:28 framed picture because I my code only read 28 to 28 image or if you want you can change settings it is up to you if you can)  so it is absolutly worthy to once try :).
